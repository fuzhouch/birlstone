Birlstone: A reStructuredText parser and content generator
=============================================================

Birlstone is a library that converts reStructuredText document into
a XML documentation, with a defined schema. The goal is to support 100%
reStructuredText constructs. The output supposes to be used to be
further processed before written to a publisher friendly format, like
PDF or HTML. With XML documentation, Birlstone also provides processor
functions to allow intermediate processing before converting to
published formats.

Birlstone also provides a simple command line tool to convert XML to
HTML5, as a built-in tool with birlstone releases. It's also used as
example to demonstrate how to use Birlstone.
